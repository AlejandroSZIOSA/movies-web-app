<!-- # React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
 -->

Technologies Used:
VITE + React: For the front-end framework.
Redux Toolkit: For global state management.
React-Router-Dom: For client-side routing.

Global State Management:
FavouritedMoviesSlice: Manages favourite movies. These are displayed on the home page and the user's personal page.
